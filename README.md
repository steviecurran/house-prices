**Training on the [House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-data-for-ml-course/data) dataset**

"*Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.*

*With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.*"

Using random forest and gradient boosting, the validations typically reach a regression coefficient of *r* > 0.92 for the log of the predicted prices against the log of the sales prices.
